# Document Dashboard

A customizable dashboard for Umbraco documents, e.g. so "container" types can show something useful
when selected in the Content tree.

## Requirements

This is implemented as a simple XSLT macro by using the [uComponents RenderMacro DataType][REND], so
you need [uComponents][UCOM] installed for it to work.
